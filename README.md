# StinkyEngine
StinkyEngine is a semi-lowend game engine. It has a very powerful entity/Ui hybrid ECS. It will take seconds to create your custom entities. StinkyEngine has a full set of systems to make game making easier & not be forced to be done in a certain way but gives freedom on how you should use those systems.

I haven't uploaded StinkyEngine to GitHub yet but can still try out our Framework here: StinkyEngine Package
